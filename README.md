## Use

 - As I have used MySQL Database which is not not default DB in Django so we have to make database manually on. 
 - Make Sure you make database on MySQL named 'gallery' . 
 - And if you are using XAMPP for MySQL then before running "python manage.py runserver" run apache server and MySQL Server on XAMPP.
 - After Configuring like above first run "python manage.py makemigrations" then run "python manage.py migrate".
 - Now whole setup is ready now runserver.
